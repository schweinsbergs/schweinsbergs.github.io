                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is an
                effective way to apply your skills to various projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface to another layout, making
                video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other
                ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                of people collaborating across oceans and borders, and
                this event specially welcomes newcomers to that style
                of event.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                code skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>

                <h2>What is CSC 426?</h2>
                <p>CSC 426 is a computer science class at Berea College.
		The complete title is CSC 426: Open Source Software
		Engineering. Here is the catalog description: </p>

		<p>An introduction to open source software engineering,
		the course covers the philosophy and practice of
		developing software in large, distributed teams. Students
		will explore social and technological aspects of this
		process by contributing directly to an existing open
		course project. In doing so, students will learn the
		tools, the techniques, and the strategies -- technical
		and social -- that are common to all developers working
		in teams through this semester-long exercise.</p>
